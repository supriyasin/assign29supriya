    "#1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\" Def statement:- Def defined functions are commonly used because of their simplicity. \n",
    "                    The def defined functions do not return anything if not explicitly \n",
    "                    returned whereas the lambda function does return an object. The def \n",
    "                    functions must be declared in the namespace. The def functions can \n",
    "                    perform any python task including multiple conditions, nested conditions \n",
    "                    or loops of any level, printing, importing libraries, raising Exceptions, etc.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "  Lambda expressions:- The lambda expressions can be used without any declaration in the namespace. \n",
    "                       The lambda  expressions defined above are like single-line functions. These  expressions\n",
    "                       do not have parenthesis like the def defined functions but instead, take parameters\n",
    "                       after the lambda  expressions as shown above. There is no return v defined explicitly \n",
    "                       because the lambda  expressions does return an object by default.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Customers who want to increase the creativity and speed of their development organizations without \n",
    "   compromising their IT team’s ability to provide a scalable, cost-eﬀective, and manageable \n",
    "   infrastructure ﬁnd that AWS Lambda enables them to trade operational complexity for agility and \n",
    "   better pricing, without compromising on scale or reliability.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Lambda beneﬁts, including the following:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  (a) No servers to manage:- Lambda runs your code on highly available, fault-tolerant infrastructure \n",
    "  spread across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in a single Region, seamlessly deploying code, and \n",
    "  providing all the administration, maintenance, and patches of the infrastructure. Lambda also provides \n",
    "  built-in logging and monitoring, including integration with Amazon CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, and AWS CloudTrail.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (b) Continuous scaling:- Lambda precisely manages scaling of your functions (or application) by running \n",
    "  event initiated code in parallel and processing each event individually.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (c) Millisecond metering:-With AWS Lambda, you are charged for every millisecond (ms) your code runs, \n",
    "  and the number of times your code is run. You pay for consistent throughput or run duration, instead of by server unit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (d) Increases innovation:- Lambda frees up your programming resources by taking over the infrastructure \n",
    "  management, allowing you to focus more on innovation and development of business logic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (e) Modernize your applications:- Lambda enables you to use functions with pre-trained machine \n",
    "  learning (ML) models to inject artiﬁcial intelligence into applications more easily. A single \n",
    "  application programming interface (API) request can classify images, analyze videos, convert \n",
    "  speech to text, perform natural language processing, and more.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (f) Support for developers:- Lambda supports developers through the AWS Serverless Application \n",
    "  Repository for discovering, deploying, and publishing serverless applications; AWS Serverless \n",
    "  Application Model for building serverless applications and integrations with various integrated \n",
    "  development environments (IDEs) (such as AWS Cloud9, AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio, AWS Toolkits \n",
    "  for Azure DevOps, and several others).\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The map(), filter() and reduce() functions bring a bit of functional programming to Python. \n",
    "   All three of these are convenience functions that can be replaced with List Comprehensions \n",
    "   or loops, but provide a more elegant and short-hand approach to some problems.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (a) The map() Function:- The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable \n",
    "   and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The syntax is:\n",
    "   map(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "    Without using lambdas\n",
    "def starts_with_A(s):\n",
    "    return s[0] == \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "fruit = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Pear\", \"Apricot\", \"Orange\"]\n",
    "map_object = map(starts_with_A, fruit)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(map_object))\n",
    "This code will result in:\n",
    "[True, False, False, True, False]\n",
    "\n",
    "  (b) The filter() Function:- Similar to map(), filter() takes a function object and \n",
    "  an iterable and creates a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "  As the name suggests, filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy \n",
    "  a certain condition, i.e. the function we passed returns True.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The syntax is:\n",
    "  filter(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "  def starts_with_A(s):\n",
    "    return s[0] == \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "fruit = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Pear\", \"Apricot\", \"Orange\"]\n",
    "filter_object = filter(starts_with_A, fruit)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(filter_object))\n",
    "\n",
    " Running this code will result in a shorter list:\n",
    " ['Apple', 'Apricot']\n",
    " \n",
    " (c) The reduce() Function:-reduce() works differently than map() and filter(). \n",
    " It does not return a new list based on the function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    " Also, in Python 3 reduce() isn't a built-in function anymore, and it can be found in the functools module.\n",
    " \n",
    " The syntax is:\n",
    " reduce(function, sequence[, initial])\n",
    " \n",
    " reduce() works by calling the function we passed for the first two items in the sequence. \n",
    " The result returned by the function is used in another call to function alongside with the \n",
    " next (third in this case), element.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process repeats until we've gone through all the elements in the sequence.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Function annotations are some random expressions which are written with the functions, \n",
    "   and they are evaluated at compile time. They do not exist at run time, and there is no \n",
    "   meaning of these expressions to python. They are used and interpreted by a third party or external python libraries.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   As we know, function annotations are used by third-party libraries because different \n",
    "   libraries have different benefits from these function annotations. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1.Function annotations with strings can be used as messages at compile time to describe t\n",
    "   he functionality of different methods, classes and variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "#5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In Python, we know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the \n",
    "   function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The following image shows the working of a recursive function called recurse.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, \n",
    "   the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example of a recursive function\n",

    "    num = 3\n",
    "    print(\"The factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n",
